# RANK-FEATURES-OF-A-SMARTPHONE---BUILD-A-PYTHON-APPLICATION-TO-CLASSIFY-AND-RANK-DATASET
ABSTRACT
Smartphones are vulnerable to fraudulent use despite having strong authentication mechanisms. Active authentication based on behavioural biometrics is a solution to protect the privacy of data in smart devices. Machine-learning-based frameworks are effective for active authentication. However, the success of any machine-learning-based techniques depends highly on the relevancy of the data in hand for training. In addition, the training time should be very efficient. 
About Dataset
This dataset contains information on battery power, clock speed, dual sim, four g, int memory, touch screen, Wi-Fi, price range, ram, talk time etc.
Data Collection
The dataset, obtained from the digital discussion room of TCSiON learning platform. 
Problem Statement
The objective of the project is to build a python application to classify and rank dataset i.e. to rank features of a smartphone.
